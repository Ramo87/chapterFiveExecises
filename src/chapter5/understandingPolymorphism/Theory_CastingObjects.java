 *                      -> casting an object from s SUBclass to a SUPERclass doest require an explicit cast;
 *                      -> casting an object from a SUPERclass  to a SUBclass  require an explicit cast;
 *                      -> compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types;
 *                      -> if the object being cast is not an instance of that class,
 *                      the compiler can throw an exception;
