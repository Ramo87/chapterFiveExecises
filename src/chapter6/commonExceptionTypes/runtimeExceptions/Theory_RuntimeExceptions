 -> they dont have to be handeled or declared;
  -> they can be thrown by th programmer or by JVM;

  Examples:
  1. Aritmetic Exceptions:  int a = 10/0;


  2. ArrayOutOfBoundsException:

                int[] a = new int[3];
                sout(a[-1]);
              ! the proble is that there is no -1 index in an array;


  3. Class Cast Exception:
   - when we deal with imposible casts;

             ex1:   String type = "moose";
                    Integer number = (Integer) type;  // does not compile! Integer is not a subclass from string;

             ex2:   String type = "moose";
                    Object obj = type;
                    Integer number = (Integer) obj;

                    ! hier the compile sees a cast from Object to Integer; this could be ok;
                  he does not realise that there is a String in the Object; when the cod runs, it trows the exception;

   4. Illegal Arguments Exception:

   5. NullPointerException :

   6. NumberFormatException - is a subclass of IllegalArgumentsException
       => for the methods that convert strings to nukbers, when we have an invalid value:
       Integer.parteInt("abc");
