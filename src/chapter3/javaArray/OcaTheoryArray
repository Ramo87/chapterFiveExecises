An array is a fixed-size area of memory on the heap that has space for primitives or
pointers to objects. You specify the size when creating it—for example, int[] a = new
int[6];.

Indexes begin with 0 and elements are referred to using a[0]. The Arrays.sort()
method sorts an array.

Arrays.binarySearch() searches a sorted array and returns the
index of a match. If no match is found, it negates the position where the element would
need to be inserted and subtracts 1. Methods that are passed varargs (…) can be used as
if a normal array was passed in. In a multidimensional array, the second-level arrays and
beyond can be different sizes.


An ArrayList can change size over its life. It can be stored in an ArrayList or List
reference. Generics can specify the type that goes in the ArrayList. You need to know the
methods add(), clear(), contains(), equals(), isEmpty(), remove(), set(), and size().
Although an ArrayList is not allowed to contain primitives, Java will autobox parameters
passed in to the proper wrapper type. Collections.sort() sorts an ArrayList.
