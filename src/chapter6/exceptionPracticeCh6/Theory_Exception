 i . Rules:
        a. in a try catch, we can have catch, final or catch + final(both). Without final or catch the cod does not compile;
        b. finally is always run and by catch block, only one!


 ii.  1. System.exit :
                    - there is one exception to the rule " the finally block runs always after the catch block".
                    - the method "system.exit(0)". The integer parameter is the error code that gets returned;
                    - system.exit tells java to end the program right now!
                    - when system.exit is called in the try catch block, the finally does not run!

                 For the exam I have to know:
                  - if an exception is a check or unchecked exception;
                  - to determine if any of the exceptions are subclasses of the others;


  iv.
            Catching various types of exceptions:
   - if is impossible to for one of the catch blocks to be executed, a compiler error about unreachable code occurs;
            that happens when a superclass is caught before a subclass;
            the order is not important if the exceptions do not inherit from each other;

            Throwing a Second Exception:
