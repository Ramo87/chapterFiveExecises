A LocalDate contains just a date, a LocalTime contains just a time, and a LocalDateTime
contains both a date and time.

All three have private constructors and are created using
LocalDate.now() or LocalDate.of() (or the equivalents for that class). Dates and times
can be manipulated using plusXXX or minusXXX methods.

 The Period class represents a
number of days, months, or years to add or subtract from a LocalDate or LocalDateTime.
DateTimeFormatter is used to output dates and times in the desired format.

The date and time classes are all immutable, which means the return value must be used.
